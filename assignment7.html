               <br> <b>Assignment 7: Proposal</b>


<p><b>Westworld “Maze” Lamp</b>
</p>

<p>Laser Cut acrylic, set into a 3D printed base with patterned inserts
<br>(Approximately 5” in diameter)
</p>
<p>Based on a design that appears frequently in the HBO series, Westworld. Without spoilers, this design will mimic the pattern, while also incorporating a coexisting but contrasting design that mimics that design associated with the human brain, which embraces the concept of duality and consciousness that the show highlights.
</p>
<p>The design will consist of a 3D printed cylinder that will contain a smaller cylinder for holding the lamp, and also include edges that two layers will rest upon to make the “shade”. The first layer will be wood (laser cut) that will contain the Westworld pattern. The second and final layer will also be laser cut, but with a pattern that more closely resembles the cortex of the human brain.
