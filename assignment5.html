               <br> <b>Assignment 5</b>

<p>For this assignment, I found the concept of the joining methods really daunting, before realizing that it was something that we had been working towards throughout the quarter.

    <br>I was struggling to conceptualize how to create a cube that would be joined only by their joints, but I realized that the concepts could apply to any 3D shape, and I started thinking about how to design 3D shapes in 2D, and looking up various nets (going back to like 3rd grade, I think that's what they're called). Once again, I turned to triangles (as my favorite shape), and could create a pyramid that would fulfill the requirements of the assignment, using something like a tongue and groove joint.

</p>

<p>I originally planned on creating the shapes needed in OnShape, but I found it actually quite hard to create the simple outlines, so I decided to turn to Illustrator.
<br>Using concepts we learned earlier in class, I measured the notches to match the thickness of the FR1, and created an "artboard" that was the size of the FR1 to determine what shapes I could fit on one piece.
<br>I then created the designs of the square pyramid, creating one base piece, with inserts on each side where the base of the triangle sides would latch in, followed by 4 triangles, 2 of a "male" piece with a tab on the sides, and 2 of a "female" piece, that would have an inset where the tabs could fit in.
<br>After making sure the tabs were the same sizes (15 mm), I exported them into .DXF file and prepared to move to the next step, KiCAD.
</p>


</p>
    <p>Here, is where I made a critical error. Repeatedly. For several hours.
<br>When importing to KiCAD, I was not changing the graphic layer it was importing to into Edge.Cuts. I did not realize I had to make that change there, and simply imported my DXF files and then saved the project to a Gerber file, where in the output settings I selected Edge.Cuts only.

</p>

<p>This simple import error would cause me much headache, as I would receive an error when trying to import the Gerber file into Bantam Tools

<p><b>Major shoutout to Hannah N.</b> for helping me realize my mistake and getting me importing my DXF's correctly, and the yellow color in KiCAD confirmed it!

<br>After this, I had to take a pause in my designs as I did not have my FR1 at this point, nor was I able to mill

</p>

<p>Once I was able to get to The Mill, to mill (nice), I had a pretty easy time getting everything set up in Bantam tools.

</p>


<p>After many false starts, I figured out that TAPE is the big key for successful milling on the BantamBox.

<br>Once I figured out how to properly use <b>tape</b>, I was in BUSINESS.

</p>

<p> I did notice some weird behavior while milling, and I believe it is due to the inaccurate settings of my z placement in Bantam.

<br>It also appears that I "double cut" my pieces due to that error in thickness setting, so that I ended up with way more pieces than I intended or needed!

<p>Upon assembly, I found that some of my pieces did not "finish" milling correctly and had jagged edges or leftover bits. This, in combination with a lack of accounting for collision between pieces (all sides of the trinagle were the same, when in reality 2 of them should have had slightly shorter bases), meant the fit was not as snug as I would have preferred. All in all, I am pretty happy with the fact that I got any pieces at all!
</p>

  <p><b>Reflection</b>
<br>Once I got the stickiness down, I quite enjoyed watching the mill roll through the FR1 with ease, and I actually kind of found it theraputic in a way! Although my pieces didn't turn out the way I wanted them to, I definitely see the big difference between additive and subtractive fabrication, and the challenges that come with each!
