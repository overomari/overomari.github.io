               <br> <b>Assignment 6</b>

<p>Death Star Ice Cubes. They're amazing and as a massive Star Wars nerd, molding the Death Star was something I knew I wanted to do immediately. Not to actually use as ice cubes, but I was familiar with the idea of using cool stuff (and silicone) to mold things. Not only would it be a fun experience, but I figured I might <i>actually</i> make something cool.

    <br>Off to Thingiverse I go!</br>
  </p>

<p>Almost immediately I found my enthuasism for crafting Imperial Bases with incredibly stupid design flaws was matched with the online community, and I found several designs to choose from.

</p>

<p>After downloading this mold, I felt in pretty good shape, as I was able to manipulate the .stl as needed (scaling), and prepare it for milling.

  </p>
<p>
<br>I then encountered a series of errors in Fusion that would not allow me to properly map and complete my toopaths.
<br><i>shocker.</i>

<p>
<br>I figured I wouldn't worry about it too much, and would get help milling from office hours on Sunday. Due to time contraints, I wasn't able to get my piece milled, but the time was very helpful for me regardless. I redesigned my pieces and was ready to 3D print.

</p>

<p>I realized I was misunderstanding the assignment, and that I would need to <b>create</b> a mold before <b>casting</b> it. Thus, my designs would work for the first mold that I make, but any subsequent casts would not capture the design.
  <br>It was here where I realized:
  <br>1. I needed to 3D print to save time and effort, and also to see if I could get more comfortable with the technique, and
  <br>2. Peter saved my life by helping me redesign my molds
</p>

</p>

<p>I 3D printed the above STL and it turned out great! From here on, it was simple as following form and allowing enough time to complete the molds.
</p>

<p> I followed the instructions and mixed the silicone and filled my 3D print mold.

<p>After setting pretty much overnight, we were ready to go with a pretty decent mold!

</p>
<p> Big shoutout to Lukas for providing a ton of the plaster / cement stuff to mold from! This part was super simple in comparison t the rest of the assignment, and made me almost feel like a grade school kid experimenting.

</p>
<p>Rinse and repeat four more times and I end up with my nearly perfect fleet of fully operational battlestations that will decimate the rebel fleet! (There are no stupid design flaws in mine, at least not intentionally!)

  <p><b>Reflection</b>
<br>This project taught me time management. With the OOMOO taking 6 hours to cure, and a holiday weekend (that I wanted to enjoy), I wanted to make sure I was able to complete this project as soon as possible, especially considering I was not making JUST one thing. While I orginally planned on milling (and subsequently bought the machinable wax), I realized that for a variety of reasons it would not be the best course for me to take, so I relied on the handy dandy 3D printing.

                <p><b>Shout Outs:</b>
<br>Shout outs to: Peter C. for helping me figure out I was designing backwards and giving me advice for fixing my STL, to Kira for sharing her <b>OOMOO</b>, and to Lukas for sharing his plaster with the class!
